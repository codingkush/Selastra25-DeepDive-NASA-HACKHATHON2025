## 🚀 Project Overview

**Deep Dive** is an **interactive web platform** that turns **NASA’s open datasets** into immersive **3D experiences** using **WebXR**, **React**, and **Three.js**.  

Instead of looking at static charts, users can **explore oceans, skies, and space** through real NASA data — directly from their browser, **no VR headset required**.

> 🎯 *“From numbers to narratives — turning NASA’s data into living experiences.”*

---

## 🌍 Problem Statement

NASA collects a **massive amount of satellite data** every day from missions like:

- 🛰 **PACE** – *Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, Ocean Ecosystem Mission*  
- 🌊 **SWOT** – *Surface Water and Ocean Topography Mission*  
- 🌎 **GRACE-FO** – *Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-On*

🔹 **The problem:**  
- The data is **too complex** for most people.  
- It’s hidden in **spreadsheets, graphs, or APIs**.  
- The **emotional story** behind the data gets lost.

> 🧩 In short: **NASA has the data — but the story is missing.**

---

## 💡 Our Solution

We built **Deep Dive Hub**, a **VR-ready storytelling platform** that transforms NASA’s data into **interactive, visual, and emotional stories**.  

Users can experience **oceans, planets, and asteroids** like never before — visually, emotionally, and interactively.

> 🌐 *“Data exists, but stories make it human.”*

## 🌊 Core Features

| 🌟 Feature | 🧩 Description |
|------------|----------------|
| 🌊 **Ocean Exploration (PACE Mission)** | Visualizes ocean color, plankton, and clouds as living oceans — not static charts. |
| 🌞 **Solar System Explorer** | Explore planets, moons, and asteroids in 3D space with real eclipse simulations and soundscapes. |
| ☄️ **Near-Earth Object Tracker** | Displays real NASA asteroid data with orbit paths and approach info. |
| 🎮 **Interactive Learning Modules** | Quizzes and challenges that make science exploration fun. |
| 🎧 **Immersive Storytelling + AI Chatbot** | Voice narration and AI explanations simplify complex data for everyone. |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **NASA Data Integration** → Fetch real datasets (PACE, SWOT, GRACE-FO).  
2. **Data Processing** → Clean, filter, and map readings into visual layers.  
3. **3D Visualization** → Render realistic oceans, skies, and celestial bodies using Three.js.  
4. **User Interaction** → Explore, play, and learn through guided immersive stories.  
5. **Impact** → Builds awareness and emotional connection to Earth science.
